# Decentralized Lending Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Lending Platform is a comprehensive DeFi solution built on blockchain technology that enables users to participate in lending and borrowing activities without traditional intermediaries. The platform allows users to deposit tokens to earn interest as lenders, or borrow tokens by providing collateral, all managed through automated smart contracts.

This project implements a peer-to-pool lending model where lenders deposit funds into a shared liquidity pool, and borrowers can access these funds by providing adequate collateralization. The platform automatically calculates interest rates, manages collateral requirements, and ensures secure transaction processing.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create an accessible, transparent, and efficient decentralized lending ecosystem that democratizes financial services. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Traditional Banking Barriers**: Remove the need for credit checks, lengthy approval processes, and geographical restrictions
- **Provide Global Financial Access**: Enable anyone with an internet connection to participate in lending and borrowing
- **Ensure Transparency**: All transactions and interest calculations are visible on the blockchain
- **Promote Financial Inclusion**: Offer competitive rates and flexible terms for both lenders and borrowers
- **Build Trustless Infrastructure**: Rely on smart contracts rather than centralized authorities

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Deposit & Earn Interest**: Users can deposit tokens into the lending pool and earn competitive interest rates (5% annual)
- **Collateralized Borrowing**: Secure borrowing system requiring 150% collateralization ratio
- **Automated Interest Calculation**: Real-time interest accrual for both lenders and borrowers
- **Flexible Repayment**: Borrowers can repay loans partially or in full at any time
- **Proportional Collateral Release**: Collateral is returned proportionally as loans are repaid

### Security Features
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Implements OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard for secure transactions
- **Ownership Controls**: Access control for administrative functions
- **Overcollateralization**: Requires 150% collateral to mitigate liquidation risks
- **Interest Rate Mechanism**: Fixed interest rates to ensure predictable returns

### Smart Contract Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of lending and borrowing logic
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient storage patterns and function implementations
- **Upgradeable Framework**: Built with future enhancements in mind
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for transparency and monitoring

### User Experience
- **Real-time Balance Tracking**: View functions to check current balances and accrued interest
- **Transparent Calculations**: Open-source interest calculation methods
- **Multiple Token Support**: Designed to work with any ERC20 tokens
- **Low Gas Costs**: Optimized contract interactions

## Future Scope

- **Flash Loan Integration**: Enable flash loan functionality for advanced DeFi strategies

### Phase 2 Developments
- **Governance Token**: Introduce platform governance token for decentralized decision making
- **Yield Farming Rewards**: Additional incentives for platform participants
- **Credit Scoring System**: Reputation-based lending with improved terms for reliable users
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Expand to multiple blockchain networks

### Phase 3 Advanced Features

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd decentralized-lending-platform

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your private key

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Deploy to Core Testnet 2
npm run deploy
```

### Environment Setup
1. Add your private key to the `.env` file
2. Ensure you have test tokens for Core Testnet 2
3. Configure network settings in `hardhat.config.js`

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Usage

### For Lenders
1. Approve the lending platform contract to spend your tokens
2. Call `deposit()` with the amount you want to lend
3. Earn interest over time
4. Withdraw your deposit plus interest when ready

### For Borrowers
1. Approve the platform to spend your collateral tokens
2. Call `borrow()` with desired borrow amount and collateral
3. Use the borrowed funds as needed
4. Call `repay()` to pay back the loan and reclaim collateral
